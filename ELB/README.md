    - How to build a scalable and cost-effective solution to handle HTTP/S redirects at scale for **multiple domains** by using
        - ALB to perform rule-based redirects,
        - AWS Global Accelerator to get static IP addresses, and
        - AWS Lambda to host redirect logic on serverless infrastructure.
