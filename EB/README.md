# Initialise EB Application and generate .elasticbeanstalk and .gitignore

# Deploy application and update Elastic Beanstalk Environment

# 1. To build and test the Docker image for the application. You need to install `docker` if you want to run it locally:

$ cd app/
$ docker build -t ${VERSION_TAG} -f Dockerfile .

# 2. To also deploy the application and update settings/configurations within EC2 instances:

$ cd app/
$ docker tag ${VERSION_TAG} ${STAGE_TAG}
$ docker push ${STAGE_TAG} || echo "Failure: ${STAGE_TAG} push failed."
$ eb deploy --region $EB_REGION $EB_ENV_NAME

# 3. To update Elastic Beanstalk Environment for instant change in After Creation state:
# 3.1  Make sure you have the latest EB environment first.
#      Because `aws:elasticbeanstalk:managedactions:platformupdate` is enabled, the Docker/platform version in
#     `Platform:PlatformArn` can be different from the last saved `*.cfg.yml` file.

$ cd app/
$ eb use [EB_ENV_NAME]              # Ensure all operations take effect to a specific EB environment
$ eb config delete [EB_ENV_NAME]    # Delete the named saved configuration (in EB S3)
$ eb config save [EB_ENV_NAME]      # Save the environment configuration settings for the current running
                                  # environment to .elasticbeanstalk/saved_configs/ with the filename
                                  # [EB_ENV_NAME].cfg.yml.

# 3.2  Edit `app/.elasticbeanstalk/saved_configs/[EB_ENV_NAME].cfg.yml`.

# 3.3  Create Pull Request for review.

# 3.4.  Apply the change

$ cd app/
$ eb use ${EB_ENV_NAME}
$ eb config --region $EB_REGION --cfg ${EB_ENV_NAME}

```

## Quick local packaging

```
$ docker build -t local/my_app .
$ docker run -d -p 8080:8080 local/my_app:latest
$ zip -r app.zip my_app env setup.py *.ini Dockerfile Dockerrun.aws.json constraints.txt MANIFEST.in

$ aws elasticbeanstalk list-available-solution-stacks
```

## Locations of file on EB EC2 Instances

### `/opt/elasticbeanstalk/hooks/appdeploy/`

1. `opt/elasticbeanstalk/hooks/appdeploy/pre/`
     1. `00clean_dir.sh` - Clean directory where source will be downloaded, removes docker containers and images.
     2. `01unzip.sh` - Download source from S3 and unzip it.
     3. `02loopback-check.sh` - Verify you don't have docker loopback setting set.
     4. `03build.sh` - Build your docker image from your `Dockerfile` or `Dockerrun.aws.json`.

2. `/opt/elasticbeanstalk/hooks/appdeploy/enact/`
     1. `00run.sh` - Execute `docker run` against the image that was generated in the pre stage based on environment
        variables and settings in your `Dockerrun.aws.json`.
     2. `01flip.sh` - Convert from aws-staging to current-app etc.

3. `/opt/elasticbeanstalk/hooks/appdeploy/post/`

## HTTPS / SSL Certificate

You can use a certificate stored in IAM with Elastic Load Balancing load balancers and CloudFront distributions.

Otherwise create yours:

1. Your profile should have the following permissions
    1. `iam:UploadServerCertificate`
    1. `iam:ListServerCertificates`

```
CALL aws iam upload-server-certificate ^
  --server-certificate-name elastic-beanstalk-x509 ^
  --certificate-body file://example.com.crt ^
  --private-key file://example.com.key ^
  --certificate-chain file://intermediate.crt ^
  --profile k-eb-deploy

:: Show all certificates
CALL aws iam list-server-certificates --profile k-eb-deploy
```

For details see [Update a certificate to IAM](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/configuring-https-ssl-upload.html).


## Ignore files

If no .ebignore is present, but a .gitignore is, the EB CLI will ignore files
specified in the .gitignore. If an .ebignore file is present, the EB CLI will
not read the .gitignore.

For details see [EB .ebignore](
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb-cli3-configuration.html#eb-cli3-ebignore).


## Known Issues

1. [AWS 'eb deploy' always returns returncode 0](
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37736392/aws-eb-deploy-always-returns-returncode-0
)
    - Use grep to get the success string. This will return a non-zero status (ie: failure) if it cannot be found:
```
eb deploy | tee /dev/tty | grep "update completed successfully"
```
