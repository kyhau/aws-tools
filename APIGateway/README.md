    1. For a REST API, you can create a VPC link to an NLB. The NLB and API must be owned by the same AWS account ([Ref](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/getting-started-with-private-integration.html)).
        - You can create a VPC link to an NLB, but not an ALB (that's the invalid endpoint address issue you've been seeing)
    1. For a HTTP API, you can create a VPC link to an ALB, NLB, or resources registered with an AWS Cloud Map service. However, all resources must be owned by the same AWS account (including the load balancer or AWS Cloud Map service, VPC link and HTTP API)

## Private API Gateways

1. Private API invocation between two separate AWS accounts

    - The setting **Enable Private DNS Name**,  will prevent all access to any regional/public API Gateway in the whole AWS region!
    - Solution 1:
        - Disable the private DNS name, and
        - Set one of following HTTP headers:
            - `Host: <api-id>.execute-api.<region>.amazonaws.com`, or
            - `x-apigw-api-id: <api-id>`
    - Solution 2:
        - Not require to set custom headers with disabled DNS resolution
        - Use a custom domain name configured in the API Gateway and an ALB in front of it.
        - Based on an IP target group, the ALB would forwards the requests to the ENIs of the VPC Endpoint.

## Public API Gateway and VPC Private DNS setting

See https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/api-gateway-vpc-connections/, AWS, 2020-12-16

Connect to public APIs with private DNS enabled
- If private DNS is enabled, use edge-optimized custom domain names or regional custom domain names to connect to your public APIs.

Connect to public APIs with private DNS disabled
- If private DNS is disabled for the interface VPC endpoint, or there is no endpoint in your Amazon VPC, confirm if the following is true:
   - Security groups for your VPC allow outbound traffic to your public API.
   - The resource policy attached to your API doesn't deny access from the VPC.
- When your Amazon VPC has permission to access your public APIs, use public DNS to connect to your public APIs.

## MTLS

- Regional API Gateway endpoints have native support for mTLS but private API Gateway endpoints do not support mTLS, so you must terminate mTLS before API Gateway. ([Source](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/consuming-private-amazon-api-gateway-apis-using-mutual-tls/))
- Private API Gateway mTLS verification using an ALB (see [Source](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/consuming-private-amazon-api-gateway-apis-using-mutual-tls/))

## Previous Security Issues or Breaking Changes

- [Removing header remapping from Amazon API Gateway, and notes about our work with security researchers](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/removing-header-remapping-from-amazon-api-gateway-and-notes-about-our-work-with-security-researchers/)
   > As of June 14, 2023, the header remapping feature is no longer available in API Gateway.

   > Before we removed the feature, we contacted customers who were using the direct HTTP header remapping feature through email and the AWS Health Dashboard. If you havenâ€™t been contacted, no action is required on your part.
