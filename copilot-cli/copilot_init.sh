Welcome to the Copilot CLI! We're going to walk you through some questions
to help you get set up with an application on ECS. An application is a collection of
containerized services that operate together.

Ok great, we'll set up a Load Balanced Web Service named api in application demo listening on port 80.

Created the infrastructure to manage services under application demo.

Wrote the manifest for service api at copilot/api/manifest.yml
Your manifest contains configurations like your container size and port (:80).

Created ECR repositories for service api.

Created the infrastructure for the test environment.
- Virtual private cloud on 2 availability zones to hold your services     [Complete]
- Virtual private cloud on 2 availability zones to hold your services     [Complete]
  - Internet gateway to connect the network to the internet               [Complete]
  - Public subnets for internet facing services                           [Complete]
  - Private subnets for services that can't be reached from the internet  [Complete]
  - Routing tables for services to talk with each other                   [Complete]
- ECS Cluster to hold your services                                       [Complete]
- Application load balancer to distribute traffic                         [Complete]

Linked account 123456789012 and region ap-southeast-2 to application demo.

Created environment test in region ap-southeast-2 under application demo.
