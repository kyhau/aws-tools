- How do Amplify and AppSync work together?
    - They have both been designed with each other in mind. A GraphQL API can be created in the AppSync Console, or created with Amplify for use by AppSync. The [AppSync documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/building-a-client-app.html#aws-appsync-building-a-client-app) recommends using Amplify if building a complete application.
