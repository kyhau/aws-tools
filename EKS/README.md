## EKS security and access control

    - [Enabling DNS resolution for Amazon EKS cluster endpoints](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/enabling-dns-resolution-for-amazon-eks-cluster-endpoints/)
    - [DNS Resolution for EKS Clusters Using Private Endpoints](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2019/12/dns-resolution-for-eks-clusters-using-private-endpoints/)
    - [Understanding Amazon EKS Cluster Private Endpoint Access](https://faun.pub/understanding-amazon-eks-cluster-private-endpoint-access-76ca52bf978a)
- [How do I provide access to other IAM users and roles after cluster creation in Amazon EKS?](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/amazon-eks-cluster-access/)
    -  Important: Keep the following in mind:
        - Avoid syntax errors (such as typos) when you update the `aws-auth` ConfigMap. These errors can affect the permissions of all IAM users and roles updated within the ConfigMap of the Amazon EKS cluster.
        - It's a best practice to avoid adding `cluster_creator` to the ConfigMap, because improperly modifying the ConfigMap can cause all IAM users and roles (including `cluster_creator`) to permanently lose access to the Amazon EKS cluster.
        - You don't need to add `cluster_creator` to the `aws-auth` ConfigMap to get admin access to the Amazon EKS cluster. By default, the `cluster_creator` has admin access to the Amazon EKS cluster that it created.
- [Manage Amazon EKS with Okta SSO](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/manage-amazon-eks-with-okta-sso/)
    - > EKS uses IAM to provide authentication to your Kubernetes cluster, but it still relies on native Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for authorization. This means that IAM is only used for authentication of valid IAM entities. All permissions for interacting with your Amazon EKS clusterâ€™s Kubernetes API is managed through the native Kubernetes RBAC system.

## EKS IAM OIDC Provider

1. `iam:*OpenIDConnectProvider*` permissions are not required when creating an EKS cluster with `CreateCluster`, which creates an **OpenID Connect provider URL** (OpenID Connect issuer URL) for the cluster (e.g. https://oidc.eks.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/id/ABCABC111222333444ABCABC11122233).
    - And in CloudTrail, there are no `*OpenIDConnectProvider*` events.

2.  After (1), the cluster has an OpenID Connect issuer URL associated with it.  To use IAM roles for service accounts, an IAM OIDC provider must exist for the cluster. See [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/enable-iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html).
You need to run `ekctl utils associate-iam-oidc-provider`,
    ```
    $ eksctl utils associate-iam-oidc-provider --cluster=k-test-oicd --approve --region=ap-southeast-2 --profile test-oidc
    ```
    - A **Open ID Provider** with the same URL as (1) is created.
    - For this step, this role needs to have the following permissions
        ```
        iam:CreateOpenIDConnectProvider
        iam:GetOpenIDConnectProvider
        iam:TagOpenIDConnectProvider
        ```
    - CloudTrail does NOT show the events as well (e.g. `CreateOpenIDConnectProvider`)
