# CodeArtifact enables you to set external repository connections and replicate them within CodeArtifact.
# An external connection reduces the downstream dependency on the remote external repository.
# When you request a package from the CodeArtifact repository thatâ€™s not already present in the repository,
# the package can be fetched from the external connection.
# This makes it possible to consume open-source dependencies used by your application.

# Using an external connection reduces interruption in your development process for package external dependencies,
# an example is if a package is removed from a public repository, you will still have a copy of the package stored
# in CodeArtifact.

# You should have a one-to-one mapping with external repositories, and rather than have multiple CodeArtifact
# repositories pointing to the same public repository.

# Each asset that CodeArtifact imports into your repository from a public repository is billed as a single request,
# and each connection must reconcile and fetch the package before the response is returned.

# By having a one-to-one mapping, you can increase cache hits, reducing time to download an application dependency
# from CodeArtifact, and reduce the number of external package resolution requests.
