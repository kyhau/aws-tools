# AWS CLI Tips and Tricks

- Standard Input/Output Redirection with "-"
    - By using the `-` character which represents standard input/output (STDIN/STDOUT), you can read or write file content directly from or to S3 without creating local copies.
    - E.g. `aws s3 cp s3://bucket-name/object-key -`

- Modifying the CloudTrail Log User-Agent with `AWS_EXECUTION_ENV`
    - When making API calls to AWS, a User-Agent header is included in each request, containing details about the client making the request. Although itâ€™s not possible to fully customize this header, you can append information to it, which can be useful for tracking API calls in CloudTrail logs.
    - One way to modify the User-Agent is by setting the `AWS_EXECUTION_ENV` environment variable, used by AWS SDKs to identify the execution environment. You can leverage this variable to append custom information to the User-Agent header, making API tracking more informative.

- Model
    - You can add additional "model" to aws cli with https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/configure/add-model.html.
    - The model will be added to `~/.aws/model/`.
    - If you need to use the same model with boto3, you will need to have the model available in `botocore/data/`.
